      "It is bordered by the provinces of Balochistān on the west and north, Punjab on the northeast, "
      "the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat to the east,and the Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh is essentially part of the Indus River delta and has derived its name from that river, which is known in Pakistan as the Sindhu. The province of Sindh was established in 1970. The provincial capital, Karāchi, is situated on the southwestern coast. "

  static final HISTORY_OF_SINDH2 = "The area of present-day Sindh province was the centre of the ancient "
      "Indus valley civilization, as represented by the sites of Mohenjo-daro, Amre, and Kot Diji. "
      "This early civilization existed from about 2300 to 1750 BC. The Arab conquest of Sindh in 711 heralded "
      "the entry of Islam into the Indian subcontinent. Sindh was part of the administrative province of Al-Sind "
      "in the Umayyad and ʿAbbāsid empires from 712 to about 900, with its capital at Al-Manṣūrah, 45 miles (72 km) "
      "north of present-day Hyderabad. With the eventual weakening of central authority in the caliphate, the Arab "
      "governors of Al-Sindh established their own dynastic rule of the region from the 10th to the 16th century. "
      "In the 16th and 17th centuries Sindh was ruled by the Mughals (1591–1700) and then by several independent "
      "Sindhian dynasties, the last of which lost the region to the British in 1843. At that time most of Sindh was "
      "annexed to the Bombay Presidency. In 1937 Sindh was established as a separate province in British India, but "
      "after Pakistani independence it was integrated into the province of West Pakistan from 1955 to 1970, at which "
      "time it was reestablished as a separate province. ";

  static final LANGUAGE_OF_SINDH = "The major indigenous languages in Sindh are Sindhi, Seraiki, and Balochi. "
      "With the entry of numerous linguistic groups from India after 1947, other languages have come to be spoken in the "
      "urban areas. Of these, the most common is Urdu, followed by Punjabi, Gujarati, and Rajasthani. The national official "
      "language, Urdu, is taught in the province’s schools, along with Sindhi. The province’s population is overwhelmingly "
      "Muslim.";
